### What?
> We have created a platform for Covid Patients to get connected with recovered patients and request for their plasma donation provided they can.

### Why?
> In this post pandemic world It's hard to find people who can donate plasma to a person in need. We see Posts/Tweets/Stories everyday people asking for plasma donation.
> 
> This project is created to solve that problem and help both sides. Help volunteers get connected with patients and vice-versa.
